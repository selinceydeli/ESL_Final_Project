    "\n",
    "**How can we improve the accuracy of predicting** which diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days across different classifiers **by addressing the severe class imbalance in the dataset?**\n",
    "The dataset we chose is on “Early Readmission Prediction of Patients Diagnosed with Diabetes,” which has a significant class imbalance between early admitted patients and others. The positive class for our classification (early admitted patients) is underrepresented with a ratio of 1-to-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques we are considering implementing to overcome the class imbalance in the dataset are as follows:\n",
    "1. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)\n",
    "2. Class weights\n",
    "3. Ensemble methods\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above techniques will be compared across different classifiers to answer the following question: How well do different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) handle the imbalance and predict early readmissions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations from Professor David:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check how different models react to class imbalance prior to implementing balancing techniques. \n",
    "- Also, check if the balancing techniques actually cause that the same objects are misclassified, or that suddenly also other objects go wrong (that used to be classified well)."
