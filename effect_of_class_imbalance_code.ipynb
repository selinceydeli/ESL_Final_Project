    "**How can we improve the accuracy of predicting** which diabetic patients are likely to be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days across different classifiers **by addressing the severe class imbalance in the dataset?**\n",
    "The dataset we chose is on “Early Readmission Prediction of Patients Diagnosed with Diabetes,” which has a significant class imbalance between early admitted patients and others. The positive class for our classification (early admitted patients) is underrepresented with a ratio of 1-to-9.\n",

    "3. Ensemble methods\n",

    "\n",
    "- Check how different models react to class imbalance prior to implementing balancing techniques. \n",
    "- Also, check if the balancing techniques actually cause that the same objects are misclassified, or that suddenly also other objects go wrong (that used to be classified well)."
